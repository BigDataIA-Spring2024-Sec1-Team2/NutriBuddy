2496,Dark Chocolate Cake,1535,Marg CaymanDesigns,PT50M,PT10M,PT1H,1999-10-23T12:27:00Z,"While it takes slightly longer to prepare this recipe than a box mix, the resulting moist, delicious cake makes it VERY worth the little extra time. I consider this 'perfect' chocolate cake. This cake is excellent with  both with Recipe #261024 and Recipe #208959 (the dark flavor version). (I use Recipe #95416 when I'm decorating the cake.) I love how the leftovers are still moist even a day or two later. (I store my loosely covered with plastic wrap.)
My father adores this cake with Recipe #261024 on it. For his birthday, Father's Day etc. I make him cupcakes with the icing on them and individually wrap them. He keeps them in his freezer for when he wants &quot;a piece of cake&quot;. He claims they are as good as when they are fresh. 
(Even though it isn't where I got the recipe from so I can't vouch for it, reviewers have said it is the recipe on the Hershey's cocoa can. I would recommend using their Special Dark Cocoa if possible.)","c(""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/24/96/WnJFBuTMQEj2PNZ1hLwg_batch23-7154.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/v1/img/feed/2496/ujrrQ86xQ8esU3YsXoyo_DarkChocCake.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/24/96/qg1ylT80TMGWTf1OrBAj_IMG_1461.JPG"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/24/96/Y9iikuBR2SyunbnXkWSm_IMG_20140814_145156.jpg"",

2758,Maultaschen (Swabian Pockets),1662,Anne Edgell,,PT0S,PT0S,1999-08-22T04:20:00Z,"It has been said that 'Maultaschen' were originally   invented in order to allow Swabians to keep eating   meat during Lent by concealing it beneath the pasta   shell and amidst the spinach filling from the eye of   the parish priest (if not the omniscient Deity   Himself).  The following recipe is typical but far   from definitive, especially where the ingredients   for the filling are concerned.  Feel free to use   whatever you have on hand or whatever your fancy (or   your conscience) dictates. Certainly if anyone were to insist that   'Maultaschen' were the most delicious of all Swabian   specialties, I[rst Scharfenberg] would hardly be   prepared to deny it.  In fact, as indicated earlier, I   suspect that 'Maultaschen' would have very good   chances in a four-way international competition with   ravioli, won tons, and pirogi for the champion- ship   of the Roughly Rectangular Pasta with Meat (plus   Miscellaneous) Filling division.",character(0),Lunch/Snacks,"c(""Pork"", ""Meat"", ""German"", ""European"", ""< 15 Mins"", ""Stove Top"")","c(""2 3/4"", ""4"", NA, ""1"", ""6"", ""3"", ""1/4"", ""1"", ""1/2"", ""1/2"", ""1"", ""3"", ""3"", NA, NA, ""1"", ""3"")","c(""flour"", ""eggs"", ""salt"", ""butter"", ""bacon"", ""onions"", ""sausage"", ""spinach"", ""Farmer's sausage"", ""eggs"", ""parsley"", ""salt"", ""pepper"", ""egg"", ""milk"")",4,2,723.2,28.1,10.1,405.9,660.4,85.1,5.4,4.6,30.7,4,,"c(""Combine the flour, eggs, and salt in a bowl and mix to   make a pasta dough."", ""Then add a little water and knead   until it has a firm but elastic consistency."", ""To make the filling, melt the butter in a skillet and   fry the bacon with the onions until both are quite   translucent.

Moisten the hard roll in water, press dry, and put   through the meat grinder (better than the food mill or   food processor), along with the bacon mixture, cooked   spinach, ground meat or smoked farm sausage, leftover   roast, etc.  Then fold in the eggs, parsley, and   seasonings; mix together."", 
""The filling should be very   spicy indeed."", ""On a board that has been sprinkled with flour, roll   out the dough into rectangular sheets (about twice as   wide as you want your 'Maultaschen' to be).
