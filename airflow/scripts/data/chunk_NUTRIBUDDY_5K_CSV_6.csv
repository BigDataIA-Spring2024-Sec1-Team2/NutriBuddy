I've gotten several z-mails asking about the candy coating. They are wafers that you melt to then dip candies into to coat them. They are usually sold in the candy section of craft or baking stores. I've seen them in the candy making section of Wal-Mart also. If you look at the ingredients photo on Recipe #104941, you'll see a photo of them. They are a different 'stiffness' than white chocolate chips but some reviews have successfully used those when they can't find the candy coating.

This should make about 85 balls."", 
""Cover tightly with aluminum foil and refrigerate overnight.  (Dough balls may be frozen for up to 6 months. Freezing seems to make the dough even more tender when baked.

All the balls may be rolled at one time, but keep pastry circles refrigerated until ready to fill. Work with only as many circles as will it an one cookie sheet at a time."", 
""To assemble kieflies, place a semi-heaping tablespoon of filling across the middle of each circle, but not quite to the edge. Fold 1/3 of the dough over filling, overlapping about half way; fold the remaining 1/3 of the dough so it overlaps the first 1/3. Use a gentle hand when overlapping the filling so that when it bakes the filling will have room to expand. Shape the rolls into crescents, using thumbs and fingers. When forming the crescents the edges might curl up slightly. Do not try to smooth out the dough. To do so would not allow the dough to expand and become flaky."",
