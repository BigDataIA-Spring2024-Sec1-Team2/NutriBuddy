4861,Cherry Pie,1535,Marg CaymanDesigns,PT55M,PT15M,PT1H10M,1999-11-24T05:53:00Z,"I got this recipe from my sister-in-law when I got married and my husband's aunt had a cherry tree. It is our favorite! Prep time does not include the time it takes to pit the cherries or make the pie crust. ;) I use the Pie Crust recipe in the Fanny Farmer Baking Book. Recipe #13619 is the recipe for 2 8-inch crust. (I've found I have to refrigerate it for the pie filling to firm up and not be &quot;soupy&quot; when it has cooled. Once it has completely chilled, you can store it at room temperature and it doesn't lose its firmness. Or, store it in the fridge and warm it in the microwave a little bit before serving it with ice cream or whipped cream if desired.)","c(""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/48/61/picqmaCts.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/48/61/qgLeQZ2XT42mCttTi9wA_IMG_20171224_153646.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/48/61/VHjKyoNeTnusOLsSvdp2_Cherry%20Pie.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/48/61/Hs2VQWWHTROw93lMNemr_IMG_20171224_153646.jpg"",

This is how I avoid that being a problem. After I cook &amp; drain the broccoli, I place it in the casserole dish while I use the same pan to make the sauce. I then pour the broccoli back into the pan to coat it and return it all to the casserole dish. Rinse the saucepan out, it doesn't need to be 'clean' just rinsed, and then use the same pan to make the melted butter and bread crumb mixture. If you use the microwave to cook your broccoli, just use the casserole dish to cook it in.

""These aren't difficult to make, but they look fancy because they  have three distinct layers.  A shortbread crust is topped by a  chocolate layer, which is then topped with a thin walnut layer. The bars freeze well, and they'll keep for several days at room temperature if stored airtight.  I've even mailed these successfully, wrapping them in pairs with the bottoms together and packaging them in a sturdy, well-padded carton before placing them in a similarly sturdy, well-padded box.  The most important thing to remember about these bars is that the chocolate layer needs some time to set up, even after the bars have cooled to room temperature.  I usually make the bars the night before I'm going to cut and serve them, but chilling the bars after they've cooled for about 20 minutes should have the same effect.""","c(""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/52/00/picbdYxFr.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/52/00/picW8ZMVw.jpg"")",Bar Cookie,"c(""Dessert"", ""Cookie & Brownie"", ""Fruit"", ""Nuts"", ""Oven"", ""< 4 Hours"")","c(""2/3"", ""1/3"", ""1"", ""1 1/3"", ""12"", ""3"", ""1"", ""1"", ""1/2"", ""1 1/2"")","c(""unsalted butter"", ""granulated sugar"", ""vanilla"", ""all-purpose flour"", ""bittersweet chocolate chips"", ""eggs"", ""granulated sugar"", ""vanilla"", ""unsalted butter"", ""walnuts"")",5,1,205.8,14,6.6,37.6,8.9,19.9,1.1,14.4,2.5,,32 bars,"c(""Line a 13 by 9 inch pan (at least 1-1/2 inches deep) with heavy-duty aluminum foil, shiny side up.
