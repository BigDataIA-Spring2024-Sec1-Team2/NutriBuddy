I have also added how to cook them for those new to cooking :)  My Mother In Law used to make pancakes for my girls when they were young as a treat when we visited. They always had them with lemon juice (she had a wonderful large lemon tree) and sprinkled them with sugar.  :)
The cooking time is approximate.
