And whether you decide to pick your own or buy from a favorite roadside vendor, serving fruit with any meal is, well, a berry good idea. Not only do fruits make a colorful and flavorful accompaniment to breakfast, lunch or dinner, they make a refreshing and healthy snack in the middle of a hot day or under a welcoming shady tree on an outing with family or friends.  HELPFUL HINTS Storing berries: After selecting healthy-looking berries - you'll want to avoid bruised or moldy fruit of any kind - refrigerate them in a single layer, loosely covered. To freeze, arrange washed berries in a single layer on a baking sheet and place in freezer until solid. Transfer them to a plastic freezer bag or container, leaving half-an-inch at the top.
