3474,Homemade Pasta,1752,Bob Ross,,PT1H,PT1H,1999-10-19T20:04:00Z,I saw this on a cooking show on TV and it's now my favourite recipe for making noodles.  The food processor does all the hard work of kneading the dough for you.  I usually dry my strips from the pasta machine a little before cutting them into noodles.  They seem to separate better that way.  I then put meal size quantities in zip lock bags and freeze  This saves hanging them up to dry.,"c(""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/34/74/f41wx70bRDmnv1JegL8d_pasta2%20(1%20of%201).jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/34/74/BHb5yZg0TbCIUCg7mtLG_CD4B433D-506D-4D85-85C2-2526CC1C2942.jpeg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/34/74/fhwT4duKQxmJD8xNNTuE_pasta1%20(1%20of%201).jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/34/74/pic5Lv13u.jpg"",

I think the praline layer adds a lovely new dimension to the traditional pumpkin pie. The pumpkin layer is the best I've ever had also. Very light and tasty without being overly sweet. A few people weren't crazy about it though because they said there was something 'wrong' with having nuts in a pumpkin pie. LOL! That's okay, that just means more for me!! And yes, you can double the praline layer, I do. You will end up with a little too much filling, but the pie will turn out fine.","c(""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/35/67/picFSmOSy.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/35/67/picUxqPHc.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/35/67/pick6FWqD.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/35/67/picCLsK8o.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/35/67/picMfRJ00.jpg""

For a puffy cookie, use shortening to keep the dough from flattening.   Get a softer cookie by sweetening it only with brown sugar. Combine brown with granulated sugar for a crispier cookie.
